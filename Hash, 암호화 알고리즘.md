# Hash / 암호화 알고리즘

## RSA 

It is an asymmetric cryptography, i.e. it uses a key to encrypt data and then uses a different key for decryption. These are normally called a public key and a private key. The public key can be used to encrypt some data and then it would require a private key for its decryption.



## AES

It is a symmetric cryptography, i.e. it uses same key for both encryption and decryption.



## SHA

It is a hash algorithm, i.e. one way encryption. So that it gives no way for decryption.
